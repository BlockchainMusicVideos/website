</p>

<p>
	9. Governing Law, Arbitration, and General Terms. These TOU, and your relationship with us under
	these TOU, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict
	or choice of laws provisions. A printed version of the TOU and of any notice given in electronic
	form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the
	TOU to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records
	originally generated and maintained in printed form. You and BCMV agree that any cause of action
	arising out of or related to the Service must commence within one (1) year after the cause of
	action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. You agree that the provisions
	in this paragraph will survive any termination of the Service. By your access of and use of the
	Service you hereby specifically acknowledge, agree and consent that you waive your right to a
	trial, by jury or otherwise, and that you agree that any suit, action, proceeding, dispute,
	controversy or claim (“Dispute”) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
	transactions contemplated herein or related to the Service or any contests or services thereon
	(including without limitation, statutory, equitable or tort claims) will be dealt with in
	accordance with the following procedures. All parties shall first attempt to negotiate all
	Disputes informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration. Such informal
	negotiations shall commence following the receipt of a notice in writing by one of the parties
	sent to the other. BCMV will send its notice to your billing address, if provided, and email you a
	copy to the email address you have provided to us. You may send any notice to BCMV to the address
	listed below. Arbitration.
</p>

<p>
	If the Dispute is not resolved through informal negotiations the Dispute (except those Disputes
	expressly excluded below) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration before
	a sole arbitrator. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN
	COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. If you are a resident of the United States, any arbitration will take
	place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. For residents
	outside the United States, any arbitration shall be initiated in New York, New York, using the
	English language in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the
	American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in effect, by one arbitrator with substantial
	experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be
	selected from the appropriate list of AAA arbitrators. The determination of whether a Dispute is
	subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by an
	arbitrator rather than a court. The prevailing party in any arbitration or other proceeding
	arising under these Terms of Service shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable
	expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses)
	incurred in connection therewith. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court
	having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award
	and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall
	have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other
	equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. Use of the Service is not authorized
	in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Terms of Service, including
	without limitation, this section. The parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the
	Dispute between you and BCMV individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration
	shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
	arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no
	right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf
	of the general public or any other persons. Severability.
</p>

<p>
	If any provision in these TOU is invalid or unenforceable or contrary to applicable law, such
	provision shall be construed, limited, or altered, as necessary, to eliminate the invalidity or
	un-enforceability or the conflict with applicable law, and all other provisions of these TOU shall
	remain in effect.
</p>

<h3>No Assignment, Sublicense or Transfer.</h3>

<p>
	You may not assign, sublicense, or transfer these TOU or any rights or obligations hereunder
	without our prior written consent. Any such attempted assignment, sublicense, or transfer will be
	null and void and we, in our sole discretion, shall have the right to immediately terminate these
	TOU.
</p>

<h3>Entire Agreement.</h3>

<p>
	These TOU set forth the entire understanding and agreement between the parties relating to its
	subject matter. Any waiver of or promise not to enforce any right under these TOU shall not be
